            Medium is not like any other platform on the internet.<span class="highlight">Our sole
            purpose is to help you find compelling ideas, knowledge, and
            perspectives.</span> We don't serve ads—we serve you, the curious reader
            who loves to learn new things. Medium is home to thousands of
            independent voices, and we combine humans and technology to find the
            best reading for you—and filter out the rest.
